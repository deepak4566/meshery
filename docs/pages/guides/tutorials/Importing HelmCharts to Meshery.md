### Introduction

Meshery is a powerful tool for managing and operating service meshes. One of its key features is the ability to import Helm charts, which simplifies the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications. This tutorial will guide you through the process of importing your first Helm chart into Meshery.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of kubernetes and Helm.
- Access to the _Meshery Playground_. If you don't have an account, sign up at [Meshery Playground](https://play.meshery.io/).

### Lab Scenario: Importing Dapr Helm Chart into Meshery Playground

In this lab, we will walk through the process of importing the Dapr Helm chart into Meshery Playground. Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, stateless, and stateful microservices. By leveraging Meshery Playground, you will experience a hands-on approach to deploying and managing the Dapr Helm chart within a live Kubernetes environment.
For more information on Dapr, visit the [Dapr Documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/?_gl=1*1v6gt5w*_ga*MTc2MjAwNzU0OC4xNzE1NjA5MTE0*_ga_60C6Q1ETC1*MTcxNjM2MTUyOC4zLjAuMTcxNjM2MTUyOC4wLjAuMA..)

### Objective

Learn to efficiently import, configure, and deploy Helm charts within Meshery Playground, enhancing your understanding of managing Kubernetes applications using Helm.

### Steps

#### Access Meshery Playground

- Log in to the [Meshery Playground](https://meshery.layer5.io/) using your credentials. On successful login, you should be at the dashboard. Press the **X** on the _Where do you want to start?_ popup to close it (if required).
- Click **Explore** in the Cloud Native Playground tile to navigate to _MeshMap_.

> **_NOTE:_** MeshMap is still in beta.
